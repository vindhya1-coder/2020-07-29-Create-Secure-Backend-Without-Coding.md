### **Create Secure Backend Without Coding**

## Protocol

_Network protocols claim to connect devices to communicate and transmit data based upon set rules_ .

The internet users also come across the terms like HTTP and HTTPS frequently. Since , we meet these terms on the internet time and again, a basic knowledge of the difference between them and how they work will be relevant to know .

Let&#39;s find out!

### HTTP stands for (HyperText Transfer Protocol) .

It uses TCP (Transmission control protocol) to channelise the data on the web. The url address is found to be http :// which simply allows communication with other devices. What exactly happens is that when a client requests any message to the server it replies with a response message such as HTTP/1.1 200 OK.

\&gt; The simple,basic and direct difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that the latter is considered to provide secured and authentic communication as the data is encrypted before sending in https and not in http.

## Create a secure Backend without Coding !!!!

### Sounds Interesting??

In this spurious surrounding the word &#39;secure&#39; is captivating in itself. [DrawPI](https://drawpi.com/) aims to provide this secure vision of creating API in seconds. Yesss! In a few seconds of working you will witness your own API in progress .

You can simply start making a new project by naming it. After selecting the named project you will find your collection dialogue box starts appearing on the screen that will form groups of Endpoints . The choice of selecting a single or multiple collection completely depends upon your preference and requirement . The next simple step will be creating a database schema through which the project will interact live .

Now the live project created through the URL(https://username-projectname.drawpi.com) is completely secure and takes you to the screen where your project will be hosting live!

Have a look to the step- by- step guidelines for a clear experience :

Project is a backend project you create. When you tap the +Create button, you are asked to enter the project name where the first character should be a-z then a-z &amp; 0-9 are allowed.

• The project when created is live on https://username-projectname.drawpi.com

• After you create a project, select a project to move over to the collection card.

• You should have at least 1 project selected to continue. 3.2

So here on this note, experience your questions and doubts live on [https://drawpi.com/](https://drawpi.com/) and yourself creating right from projects to DB schema screen in just few countable seconds !
